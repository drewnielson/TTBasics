Plan to use 4.A sample to demo for all keyboard samples except 4.C
4.A sample has a failure for the Submit button
NO plan to demo - 4.B no sample for this
4.C plan to use https://interactiveaccessibility.com/education/training/ex7.1.html
4.D - plan to use https://www.nps.gov/blri/index.htm (Blue Ride Parkway loss of focus between elements - no frames or iframes)  
NEED SAMPLE of unexpected change for 4.E inserted into 4.A sample
4.F plan to use https://www.nps.gov/grca/index.htm (Grand Canyon modal dialog box - doesn't always appear though)
BROKEN EXAMPLE NEEDS FIX of 4.G for revealed content - I trie to copy from existing course website.
BROKEN EXAMPLE of 4.G - create failures there for 4.F and 4.H
